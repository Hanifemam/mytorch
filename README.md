# mytorch — A Minimal Deep Learning Library using PyTorch

## 🔍 Purpose

`mytorch` is a handcrafted deep learning library built using PyTorch. This project serves as an educational tool with the following goals:

- 📚 Understand **deep learning** from the ground up
- 🔥 Learn **PyTorch** at a low level, beyond high-level abstractions
- 🧱 Build a **modular, extensible ML library** from scratch
- 🔧 Apply **software engineering** principles: clean design, testing, documentation, and version control

## 🚧 Project Status

This is a work in progress. The library will be built incrementally, beginning with basic components:

- Custom layers (e.g. Linear, ReLU)
- Loss functions (e.g. MSE, CrossEntropy)
- Optimizers (e.g. SGD, Adam)
- Neural network training loop
- Sample models (e.g. linear regression, classifiers)
- Utility modules and testing framework

PyTorch will be used directly—**no torch.nn or torch.optim shortcuts.**
